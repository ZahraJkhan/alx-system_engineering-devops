# API advanced

# Background Context
Questions involving APIs are common for interviews. Sometimes they’re as simple as ‘write a Python script that queries a given endpoint’, sometimes they require you to use recursive functions and format/sort the results.

A great API to use for some practice is the Reddit API. There’s a lot of endpoints available, many that don’t require any form of authentication, and there’s tons of information to be parsed out and presented. Getting comfortable with API calls now can save you some face during technical interviews and even outside of the job market, you might find personal use cases to make your life a little bit easier.


## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. How many subs?**
  * [0-subs.py](./0-subs.py): Python function that returns the total number of
  subscribers for a given subreddit.
  * Returns `0` if an invalid subreddit is given.

* **1. Top Ten**
  * [1-top_ten.py](./1-top_ten.py): Python function that prints the top ten
  hottest posts for a given subreddit.
  * Prints `None` if an invalid subreddit is given.

* **2. Recurse it!**
  * [2-recurse.py](./2-recurse.py): Python function that recursively returns a
  list of titles for all hot articles on a given subreddit.
  * Returns `None` if no results are found on the given subreddit.

* **3. Count it!**
  * [100-count.py](./100-count.py): Python function that recursively prints a
  sorted count of given keywords parsed from titles of all hot articles on a given
  subreddit.
  * Keywords are case-insensitive and delimited by spaces.
  * Results are printed in descending order by count.
  * Words with identical counts are sorted alphabetically.
  * Words with no matches are skipped.
  * Results are based on the number of times a keyword appears - ie.,
  `java java java` counts as three separate instances of `java`.
