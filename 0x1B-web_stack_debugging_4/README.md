# Web stack debugging #4

This was the fifth in a series of web stack debugging projects. In these
projects, I was given broken/bugged webstacks in isolated containers,
and tasked with fixing the web stack to a working state. For each
task, I wrote a script automating the commands necessary to fix the
web stack.
